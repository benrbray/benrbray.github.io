<ExactQuote>
A pretty printer is a tool, often a library of routines, that aids in converting a tree into text.  The text should occupy a minimal number of lines while retaining indendation that reflects the underlying tree.

Many popular code formatters, including JavaScript's [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/docs/en/technical-details), are based on Wadler's pretty-printing algorithm.

The original paper [@wadler2003:prettier].

## Wadler's Prettier Printer

Prettier is based on the following basic operations:

```haskell
(<>)   :: Doc -> Doc -> Doc  -- concatenation
nil    :: Doc                -- empty document
text   :: String -> Doc      -- literal string
line   :: Doc                -- line break
indent :: Int -> Doc -> Doc  -- increase indent level
```

<ExactQuote>
Here `<>` is the associative operation that concatenates two documents, which has the empty document `nil` as its left and right unit.
</ExactQuote>

```haskell
-- for any document `d :: Doc`,
doc == (nil <> doc) == (doc <> nil)
```

A **layout** renders a notation as a string.

```haskell
layout :: Notation -> String
```

## Why I Prefer Configurable Formatters

the preferred coding style of a community changes over time, especially when influenced my other languages.  Rust and Haskell have both had a huge impact on other languages.

Most languages are expressive enough to support many vastly-different coding styles.

The example I know best is **Scala**:  Some programmers fully embrace functional programming idioms through frameworks such as `cats` or `zio`, while others who use it as an alternative to Java prefer a more traditional imperative style.

I think this stance misses the point:  Teams should be free to come to a consensus about which coding style best suits their needs.  It's not possible for the authors of a no-config formatter to know in advance which style is best for everyone.

* The preferred coding style may change over time, especially when influenced by other languages, or when new features arrive.  No-config formatters are slow to adapt to these changes.

*Good enough is the enemy of good. 
* Notation as a tool of thought.
* code is _read_ more often than it is _written_
* formatters take away the programmer's ability to emphasize or de-emphasize

### Example:  `prettier` and early returns

The **early-return** style of programming has a number of advantages:

* makes assumptions / preconditions explicit at the very beginning of the function
* keeps the indentation level in a function to a minimum
* discard all edge cases as early as possible, so the main body of the function is focused only on the happy path / business logic

It's clear that `prettier`
