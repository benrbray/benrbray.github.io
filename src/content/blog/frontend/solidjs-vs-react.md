summary: While I mostly use `react` at work, I tend to prefer `solid-js` for my personal projects because I find that the `solid-js` approach to reactive programming makes it much easier to interact with the outside world.  In this post, I demonstrate this difference by implementing a `codemirror` component in both frameworks.
