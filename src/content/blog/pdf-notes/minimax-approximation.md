summary:  "First formalized by Weierstrass in 1885, approximation theory concerns the best approximation of
arbitrary functions by some class of simpler functions. The structure of an approximation problem involves three central components: a function class containing the function to be approximated, a form of approximating function, and a norm for measuring approximation error.  These notes introduce <b>minimax polynomial approximation</b>, whereby continuous functions on a closed interval are
approximated by polynomials using the infinity norm to measure fit."
