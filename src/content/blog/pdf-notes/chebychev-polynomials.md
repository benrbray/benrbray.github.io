summary:  "The <b>Chebyshev polynomials</b> appear frequently in numerical analysis and are incredibly useful for
analyzing and accelerating the convergence of iterative methods. One might even say that Chebyshev
polynomials are the best polynomials, a fact which can be made precise in a variety of different ways. In
these notes, we define Chebyshev polynomials and their basic properties, before discussing their utility in
minimax approximation theory, which was the subject of a previous set of notes."
