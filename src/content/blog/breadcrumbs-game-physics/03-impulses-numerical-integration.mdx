# Impulse-Velocity vs. Force-Acceleration

> I recommend that you think of rigid body physics in terms of
impulses and velocities, rather than forces and accelerations.
Why? Friction is much better behaved at the impulse-velocity
level and it also allows us to treat resting contact in the same
way as colliding contact. -- [@tonge2013:iterative-rigid-body]
