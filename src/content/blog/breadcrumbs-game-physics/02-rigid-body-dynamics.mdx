# Notation

## Vectors

* **vectors** are column vectors
* **pseudovectors** are columns vectors 
* **covectors** are row vectors

### Cross Product

The cross product $\vec{v} \times \vec{w}$ can be written as a matrix product $[\vec{v}]_\times \vec{w}$, where $[\vec{v}]_\times$ is the following skew-symmetric matrix built from the components of $\vec{v}$:

$$
[\vec{v}]_\times = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -v_z & v_y \\
v_z & 0 & -v_x \\
-v_y & v_x & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Physical Quantities

* $p$ position
* $v = \begin{bmatrix} v_x \; v_y \; v_z \end{bmatrix}^T \in \R^3$ for velocity
* $\rho$ for momentum
* $R$ for the orientation matrix
* $q$ for the quaternion representing orientation 
* $\omega$ for angular velocity

### Three Dimensions

### Two Dimensions

## Generalized Quantities

* $q$ generalized position
* $u = \dot{q}$ generalized velocity

Following [@andrews2022:siggraph-contact-friction], <ExactQuote>the Newton-Euler equations of motion that govern the dynamics of a physical system form a second-order ODE that can be written as</ExactQuote>

$$
\vec{M}(t) \dot{\u}(t) = \f(\q(t), \u(t), t)
$$

where

* $\vec{M}(t)$ is the generalized mass matrix
* $\q(t)$ are the generalized positions
* $\u(t)$ are the generalized velocities
* $\f(\q,\u,t)$ are the generalized forces acting on the system

the generalized mass matrix includes both ordinary mass as well as the components of the **inertial tensor**, which can be thought of as "angular mass",

$$
M = \begin{bmatrix}
m &       & \\
  & m &   & \\
  &   & m & \\
&&& I_{xx} & I_{xy} & I_{xz} \\
&&& I_{yx} & I_{yy} & I_{yz} \\
&&& I_{zx} & I_{zy} & I_{zz}
\end{bmatrix}
$$


# Rigid Body Assumption

> The (linear and angular) velocity at the center of mass of a rigid body
> uniquely determines the velocity at every point within the body.

# Angular Velocity and Impulse

## Convert Center-of-Mass Velocity to Point Velocity

Following [@bergen2010:game-physics-pearls, ch. 1], <ExactQuote>the linear velocity at a displacement $r$ from the center of rotation of an object moving with linear velocity $v_l$ is</ExactQuote>:

$$
\v_{point} = \v_{lin} + \omega \times \r
$$

In two dimensions, we can imagine the angular velocity as a (pseudo)vector $\omega \hat{k}$ pointing "out of the page", with all physical vector quantities having zero for the $z$-component.

$$
\v_{point}
= \v_{lin}
+ \omega \begin{bmatrix} - r_y \\ r_x \end{bmatrix}
$$

## Convert Point Impulse to Center-of-Mass Impulse

Given a rigid body impulse $I$,

$$
\u_{out} = \u_{in} + M^{-1} I
$$
