## General

[@erleben2005:physics-based-animation]

* Chapter 6, "Impulse-Based Multibody Animation"
  - contains a thorough explanation of multibody physics & the contact model
  - provides justification for simplifying assumptions needed for realtime simulation 
* Chapter 7, "Constraint-Based Multibody Animation"

[@tonge2013:iterative-rigid-body]

* an extended version of [@tonge2012:solving-rigid-body-contacts], the same author's presentation from the previous year

## Sequential Impulse Algorithm

[@catto2005:temporal-coherence]

* velocity-based scheme with an approximate friction model
* constraint-based approach enables support for wide variety of joint types:  revolute, prismatic, breakable joints, triggers, etc.
* joints and contacts are both handled in the same way

> Fortunately, the performance and space requirements can be balanced by low accuracy requirements. As long as the motion is visually plausible, the physics programmer is free to modify the equations of motion and to approximate the contact
geometry. Furthermore, the chosen model does not need to be solved to high
precision. As long as stability is maintained, numerical accuracy has secondary
importance. -- [@catto2005:temporal-coherence]

## Reference Implementations

[Cirobb](https://github.com/jonpena/Cirobb) Rigid Body Physics Engine

> Cirobb is a 2D Rigid Body Physics Engine inspired by Box2D Lite that was created with the purpose of helping people who are starting in this wonderful world of physics for Videogames. The Engine uses the Erin Catto's Contact Persistence Algorithm and it's implementation of the PGS (Projected Gauss Seidel) solver to solve the MLCP very well known as a SI (Sequential Impulse).
