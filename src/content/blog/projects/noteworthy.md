# Noteworthy

A free, open-source, local-first Markdown editor built with [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/).

* Works directly with your **local** files, entirely **offline**.
* Write your notes in **Markdown**, plus a few optional extensions.
* Build your own personal wiki with **bidirectional links**.
* Excellent **math** support â€” seamlessly transition between source and rendered math, thanks to [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) and [prosemirror-math](https://github.com/benrbray/prosemirror-math).

## Acknowledgements

* Thanks to [Marijn Haverbeke](https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/) for developing [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/)!
* Thanks to [Hendrik Erz](https://github.com/nathanlesage) for keeping [Zettlr](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr) open source!  When I started developing Noteworthy, I had no clue how to set up an Electron app or responsibly interact with the user's file system from Node, and the Zettlr source was a great reference.
* Thanks to Microsoft for keeping [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) open source!  I learned a lot by reading the source of the VS Code tree viewer and plugin system.
* Thanks to [Fabio Spampinato](https://fabiospampinato.com/) for releasing the source to an early version [Notable](https://github.com/notable/notable)!
