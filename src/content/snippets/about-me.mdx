I work as a **research software engineer** for [Hasuo Lab](https://group-mmm.org/~ichiro/) at the <a href="https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/">National Institute of Informatics</a> in Tokyo, Japan, where I use **Haskell** to design domain-specific programming languages for formal verification of cyberphysical systems.

My ambition is to design software which makes **formal verification** more accessible to developers. I'm particularly interested in improving the user experience of **dependently-typed programming**.

{/*
I work most comfortably at the edge of where <b>theory meets practice</b>, and enjoy building tools for domain experts with a tight feedback loop.

In my free time, I enjoy cycling, [goats](/images/photos/ben-goat.jpg), dodgeball, [long walks](/images/photos/tokyo-walking-map.jpg), and [baking](/images/photos/sourdough.jpg).  Maybe one day I'll make more [games](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/512482)! If you'd like to chat, feel free to write me at <a href="mailto:benrbray@gmail.com">benrbray@gmail.com</a>.
