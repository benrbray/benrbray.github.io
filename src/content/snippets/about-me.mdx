I'm a full-stack software engineer currently living in Tokyo, Japan.  These days, I'm most interested in working on:

* Language servers, static analyzers, and compilers.
* Interactive editors for composing rich text documents.
* Computer graphics, simulation, and numerical methods.

I most often reach for **TypeScript**, **Rust**, or **Haskell** when starting a new project.  In my free time, I enjoy cycling, [goats](/images/photos/ben-goat.jpg), dodgeball, [long walks](/images/photos/tokyo-walking-map.jpg), and [baking](/images/photos/sourdough.jpg).  Maybe one day I'll make more [games](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/512482)!
