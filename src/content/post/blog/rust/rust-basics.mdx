## Ownership Rules

See ["What is Ownership?"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html)

1. each value in Rust has an **owner**
2. there can only be one owner at a time
3. when the owner goes out of scope, the value is **dropped**

### Scope and `Drop`

We can freely create new scopes with curly braces `{ }`:

```rust
{                  // s is not valid here, it's not yet declared
  let s = "hello"; // s is valid from this point forward
  // [...]
}                  // the scope ended, and s will be dropped
```

Data types like `String` which manage their own heap-allocated memory implement the `Drop` trait, whose `drop` method is called whenever they go out of scope:

```rust
impl Drop for String {
  fn drop(&mut self) {
    // [...]
  }
}
```

### Move and `Copy`

Types that implement the `Copy` trait will be _copied_ under reassignment.  This includes simple stack-allocated types like integers and string literals:

```
let x = 5;
let y = x; // y will hold a copy of x
```

For types which do not implement `Copy`, the situation is different.  Rust has no concept of "shallow copy", as it would lead to multiple ownership and therefore potential *double-free* errors.  Instead, reassignment _invalidates_ the original variable.  In other words, the value is _moved_ from `x` to `y`.

```
let x = String::from("hello");
let y = x;
```

To instead make a deep copy of the data, one may use `clone`:

```
let x = String::from("hello");
let y = x.clone();
```

Note that the `Drop` and `Copy` traits are **mutually exclusive**.  Rust will not allow both traits to be implemented for the same type.

### Ownership and Functions

* Passing a variable to a function will either move or copy, just as assignment does.
* Returning values can also transfer ownership.

### References

* **References** (`&var`) allow referring to a value without taking ownership of it.
* The action of creating a reference is called **borrowing**.
* **Mutable references** (&mut var) allow modifying a borrowed value.
* Mutable references must be exclusive:  If you have taken a mutable reference to a value, you may have no other references to that value (mutable or otherwise!).

# Arenas

## Manish Goregaokar 2021, ["Arenas in Rust"](https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2021/03/15/arenas-in-rust/)
* an **arena** is a way to group up allocations that are expected to have the same lifetime
* sometimes you need to allocate a bunch of objects for the lifetime of an event, after which they can all be thrown away
* it's more efficient to reduce **allocator pressure** by _preallocating_ memory for these objects, rather than calling the system allocator once per object

for example, in a game there may be a large mishmash of per-frame-tick objects to be allocated per frame, then immediately thrown away
  * with arenas, we can allocate an arena beforehand, then cheaply fill it up and clear it each frame
  * this has the additional benefit of **cache locality**

arenas also help represent **self-referential** data

* e.g. complex graph with cycles as needed when writing compilers & type systems

other

* `slotmap` is a map-like data structure useful for self-referential data, based on generational indexing
* `bumpalo` is a "bump allocator" which allows heterogeneous contents, and permits cycles (with the caveat that destructors are not called)
* `typed-arena` is an arena allocator that stores objects of a single type and allows for cyclic references.
  * (always runs destructors on its contents when the arena itself goes out of scope)

## Chris Wellons, ["Arena allocator tips and tricks"](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2023/09/27/)

* an arena is a memory buffer and an offset into that buffer, initially zero
* to allocate an object, grab a pointer at the offset, and advance the offset by the size of the object
* objects are not freed individually; instead, groups of allocations are freed at once by restoring the offset to an earlier value
* without individual lifetimes, you don't need to write destructors, nor do programs need to wlak data structures at runtime to take them apart

## Implementing a Self-Referential Arena

The key to implementing an arena `Arena` with entries typed as `Entry` is:

* `Arena` and `Entry` both have a lifetime parameter `Arena<'arena>` and `Entry<'arena>`
* `Arena` methods should all receive `Arena<'arena>` as `&'arena self`
  * makes `'arena` an [invariant](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/subtyping.html#variance) lifetime
* `Entry` should almost always be passed around as `&'arena Entry<'arena>`
* use interior mutability
  * if using `unsafe`, make sure you have a `PhantomData` for `RefCell<Entry<'arena>>` somewhere
