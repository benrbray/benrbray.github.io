## Series Overview

### Audience

* you took a calculus or linear algebra course long ago, but may have forgotten most of the details

### Goals

* explain game physics in a modular way, making a clear distinction between *physical models* and *computational models*

## Design Constraints

* physics solvers are expected to run in realtime
* thankfully, the results only need to be **physically plausable**
* stable

# Constraints

## Position-Based vs. Velocity-Based

* Rigid body simulation has traditionally used **velocity-based dynamics**, where constraint solvers can only modify object velocities. 
* Under **position-based dynamics** [@bender2017:pbd-survey], constraints are enforced by directly projecting the positions of objects, rather than indirectly through a velocity update.
