# Considerations on Codecrafting, ["Designing Type Inference for High Quality Type Errors"](https://blog.polybdenum.com/2025/02/14/designing-type-inference-for-high-quality-type-errors.html)

Written by the author of PolySubML,

* a programming language combining global type inference with subtyping and advanced polymorphism
* supporting good type error messages as a primary consideration

**Rule 1: Never Guess or Backtrack**

* The job of a compiler is to prove to the user that their code is invalid, ideally in a way that guides the user to a solution.
* The process of typechecking is _deriving a set of facts_ about the program.
  * checking is straightforward if facts are of the form `if A and B and C, then D` ✔
  * however, facts of the form `if A and B and C, then D or E` ✖ cause branching, and require the compiler to _guess_!
* Languages with **ad-hoc overloading** are often guilty of this mistake.  When the same function name is assigned multiple type signatures, the compiler needs to try _all_ of them before it can return a type error!
  ```
  void foo(A x) {}
  void foo(B x) {}
  void foo(C x) {}
  //...
  foo(v);
  ```
* This branching can cause _exponential-time typechecking_ bugs.
  * In Swift 3.1, `let a: Double = -(1 + 2) + -(3 + 4) + -(5)` took [20 seconds](https://www.cocoawithlove.com/blog/2016/07/12/type-checker-issues.html) to compile!
  * Exponential typechecking [example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30707387/troubleshoot-slow-compilation) in Java.

**Rule 2: Don't Jump to Conclusions**

* If two values are expected to have the same type, don't automatically assume the first one is the "gold standard"!
  - With code like `let _ = [1; ""]` in a lanaguage with homogeneous lists, most typecheckers will constrain the type to be `Int[]` after seeing the first element, and report `""` as the error, without considering that the user intended to actually create a list of strings!

**Rule 3: Ask user to clarify intent**

**Rule 4: Allow explicit type annotations**

* Some languages (Rust) have type which exist in the type system, but for which there is _no syntax to actually write the type_!  Your code works as long as the types are inferred, but they cannot actually be specified explicitly.
* **Any type that can be inferred must also be possible to write explicitly.**

**Rule 5: Do not include static type inference in your runtime execution model.**

* Haskell's typeclass systems mean that type annotations can change _runtime_ behavior by changing which typeclass implementation is used.
