# [@jones2007:practical-arbitrary-rank] [Peyton-Jones] Practical Type Inference for Arbitrary-Rank Types

Introduction

* This paper extends the Hindley-Milner type inference algorithm, allowing for functions with **higher-rank types**.  That is, functions that can accept other polymorphic functions as arguments.
* This extension has the following properties:
  * Any program typeable with Damas-Milner remains typeable.
  * Accommodates types of arbitrary finite rank.
  * Some manual type annotations may be required, but the type system specifies precisely which annotations are required and which are optional.
  * These new features come with minimal added complexity.
  * Existing Damas-Milner implementations can be easily modified to support the extended system.

Connections to Other Work

* [Odersky & Laufer] propose a $\lambda$-calculus which supports arbitrary-rank polymorphism through type annotations on lambda-bound subterms.  We extend this using [Pierce & Turner]'s **local type inference**.

Examples where Higher-Rank Types Arise

* The need for higher-rank types arises when a polymorphic function must be instantiated to two different concrete types in the same scope.  For instance,
  ```haskell
  example :: ([Bool], [Char])
  example = let f x = (x [True, False], x ['a', 'b'])
             in f reverse
  -- the type of x is polymorphic,
  --     x :: forall c. [c] -> [c]

  ```
* If we desugar the `Monad` typeclass into an ADT, its two members `return` and `(>>=)` have polymorphic types.  Implementing a function such as `mapM` involves instantiating `(>>=)` to more than one concrete type in the same function body.
* More examples:  Data structure fusion `build`, state monad `runST`, nested data types, 

## Higher-Ranked Types

The **rank** of a type describes the depth at which universal quantifiers appear _contravariantly_.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Monotypes} && \tau, \sigma^0 &::= a \mid \tau_1 \rightarrow \tau_2 \\
\text{Polytypes} && \sigma^{n+1} &::= \sigma^n \mid \sigma^n \rightarrow \sigma^{n+1} \mid \forall a. \sigma^{n+1} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

A rank-0 type, having no universal quantifiers, is called a **monotype**, and types of higher rank are called **polytypes**.  For example,

```haskell
Int -> Int                -- rank 0
forall a. a -> a          -- rank 1
Int -> (forall a. a -> a) -- rank 1
(forall a. a -> a) -> Int -- rank 2
```

## Subsumption

Suppose that we have variables bound with the following types:

```haskell
k :: forall a b. a -> b -> b
f1 :: (Int -> Int -> Int) -> Int
f2 :: (forall x. x -> x -> x) -> Int
```

* Is the application `(f1 k)` well-typed?  **Yes!**  Instantiate $a = b = \texttt{Int}$.
* Is the applicatoin `(f2 k)` well-typed?  **Yes!**  The function `k` is more polymorphic than `f2` requires.

[Odersky & Laufer] use the term **subsumption** for the "more polymorphic than" relation.  When extended to arbitrary rank, the usual co/contra-variance phenomenon occurs:
  * $\sigma_1 \rightarrow \texttt{Int}$ is more polymorphic than $\sigma_2 \rightarrow \texttt{Int}$ if $\sigma_1$ is _less_ polymorphic than $\sigma_2$.

## Predicative vs. Impredicative Type Systems

Once one allows polytypes nested inside function types, it is natural to ask whether one can also call a polymorphic function at a polytype. For example,

```haskell
revapp :: a -> (a->b) -> b
revapp x f = f x

poly :: (forall v. v -> v) -> (Int, Bool)
poly f = (f 3, f True)
```

Is the application `(revapp (\x->x) poly)` legal? The type variable a would need to be instantiated with `forall v. v -> v`.

* A type system which allows polymorphic functions to be instantiated with a polytype is called **impredicative**.
* A **predicative** type system only allows a polymorphic function to be instantiated with a monotype.

The type system presented by [@peyton-jones2007:inference-arbitrary-rank] is predicative. An inference algorithm for an impredicative type system was presented by [@serrano2020:quick-look-impredicativity] and introduced into GHC.

## Higher-Kinded Types

Higher-rank and higher-kinded types play well together, and are almost orthogonal to each other in terms of implementation.  So, the paper leaves HKTs only as a side note!

# Type Systems for Higher Rank Types

* We prefer to write type system rules in **syntax-directed** style, which means 
* Why write typing judgements in a _non_-syntax-directed style?  For ease of proving mathematical properties.


this is <InlineType>forall x. x -> x</InlineType> asdf

## Supporting Type Annotations:  Open vs. Closed

* **open** type annotations have _free_ type variables, like `forall a. a -> b` ($b$ is free)
