title: 'Breadcrumbs: Building a Game Physics Engine'
---

This series walks through the design and implementation of a two-dimensional, real-time game physics engine in Rust. We will cover all the basic components of a physics engine, introducing the necessary math and physics background along the way. Through interactive demos, we'll identify solutions to common game physics bugs, and investigate tradeoffs between accuracy and performance.
