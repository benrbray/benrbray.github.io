The classic Windows simulation game, played more than **2.5 million** times!

* Browse the internet with **Internet Appendage 8**!
* Create your own games with **Adoozy Falsch CS4 Professional**!
* Compose ransom letters with help from **Clippy**!
* Keep your viruses up to date with **NoTron Virus**!

There are a few bugs & broken features due to limitations of the [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) emulator.

* Windows may appear off-screen.  Click the edge of a window to drag it back.
* If scrolling with your mouse doesn't work, try tragging the scrollbars.

*Disclaimer:*  This game is full of childish humor, since I was a child when I made it :).  Many of the jokes have not aged well, or were in bad taste to begin with.

Play the [original version](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/512482) on Newgrounds.  Made with Flash / AS3.
