## Skills

**Functional Programming, Compilers, and Formal Methods:**
I enjoy the expressiveness and safety that comes with pure, statically-typed functional programming.  I'm especially interested in type systems and language server implementation. 

* As a research engineer for Hasuo Lab at NII, I used **Haskell** to develop domain-specific programming languages for formal verification of cyberphysical systems, in collaboration with researchers from Japanese car manufacturers.
  * Worked on `tempo-lang`, a language which compiles to **signal temporal logic** expressions.  I extended the parser and typechecker to support record types, enums, and user-defined functions.
  * I also worked on an **exemplifier** which generates examples of signals which either satisfy or violate the temporal property described by a `tempo-lang` specification.  We achieved this by converting `tempo-lang` expressions into [satisfiability problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories), and reconstructing a signal from satisfying assignments found by the [`z3` SMT solver](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/z3-3/).
* As a backend engineer at Smartpay, I wrote purely-functional **Scala** in tagless-final style using the [`cats-effect`](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/) ecosystem.  A [functional core, imperative shell](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell/) architecture enabled us to work quickly, with confidence.
* I have basic familiarity with the **`coq` proof assistant**, having worked through all the exercises in Volumes 1-3 of the [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/) book, as well as portions of [CPDT](http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/).
* In my free time, I enjoy working with **dependently-typed** languages like Idris and Lean.  I created the toy language [`yagi-lang`](https://github.com/benrbray/yagi-lang) to learn more about dependent type theory.
* **TODO:** datalog tagging system
* **TODO:** coalgebraic product construction
* **TODO:** type safari
{/* * I’ve also read through the first 5 chapters of the Homotopy Type Theory:  Univalent Foundations of Mathematics book, to better understand the formal systems that powers proof assistants like Coq. */}
{/* I enjoy reading papers about programming language theory, type systems, formal verification, and category theory in my free time. */}

**Computer Graphics & Numerical Simulation:**

* I wrote a C++/CUDA simulation of 2D incompressible fluid flow, based on the “Stable Fluids” paper by Jos Stam.  I compared a few different numerical methods, including parallel Jacobi on the GPU and preconditioned conjugate gradient on the CPU.
* I completed graduate courses on computer architecture, compilers, and parallel computing.  My course projects were all written in C++.  Projects for the compilers course involved writing LLVM analysis / transformation passes on LLVM IR.
* In my role as a **computer vision engineer** at EmbodyMe, I trained deep learning models to transfer facial expressions from one video to another.  I also contributed to graphics the post-processing pipeline; for example, by applying spherical harmonics lighting to the meshes output by our model.
  - I maintained our Python/PyTorch codebase (which includes training and visualization code for face-reenactment and inpainting models).
  - I led a biweekly deep learning & graphics reading group to follow recent developments (GANs / attention / transformers / distillation / NeRF) and distribute knowledge among the team.
* As an undergraduate student, I spent three years as a research assistant using natural language processing to analyze a large corpus of 19th-century German periodicals.
  -  I implemented algorithms for topic modeling (LDA/HDP) from scratch in Python.
  - I designed a custom OCR error correction scheme for German blackletter fonts.
  - I trained a logistic regression classifier for place-name detection.
  - I built a web-app allowing humanities researchers to browse our dataset and visualize the results of our topic modeling analysis.

Early in my career, I also worked as a freelance **game developer**.  Read more by following the link:

**Frontend Engineering:** I have 6 years of experience writing TypeScript.

I have a particular interest in the design of rich document editors for note-taking, documentation, and academic writing. 

* **TODO:** TypeScript & React for DriveSGL and Tempo-Forms for Hasuo Lab @ NII
* I created [Noteworthy](https://github.com/benrbray/noteworthy), an offline Markdown editor with bidirectional links and interactive math editing.
  * `noteworthy-vscode` allows the Noteworthy editor to be used to edit Markdown files within Visual Studio Code
  <PostPreview postSlug="projects/noteworthy" />
* My `prosemirror-math` package adds support for interactive LaTeX equation editing to the `prosemirror` editor framework.
* My `remark-cite` package adds support for `pandoc`-style citation syntax to the `remark` markdown parser, as well as for formatting bibliographies using data from `*.bib` files.
* I have a deep working knowledge of the `codemirror` and `prosemirror` editors, and have authored dozens of custom plugins for each.
* I'm proficient with both the `react` and `solid-js` reactive frameworks. <PostPreview postSlug="frontend/solidjs-vs-react" />

**User Experience:** 

* TODO

**Backend Engineering:**

* I worked for one year as a **backend engineer** at Smartpay KK writing **Scala**.
  * Led the design, implementation, testing, and release of a "programmatic disbursements" backend service which integrates with bank APIs to automatically issue merchant payouts and consumer refunds on a fixed schedule.
  * Collaborated with our frontend team to design a **GraphQL** API to power our mobile app.
  * Contributed to the backend API powering the mobile & web apps for a pay-later service.
  * Worked with **Google Cloud Platform**, Postgres, and Terraform Cloud.
* I have experience with [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en), Scala's [`http4s`](https://http4s.org/), Haskell's [`servant`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant), and Python's [`flask`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/).

**Technical Writing:** Here are a few samples of my writing:

<PostPreview postSlug="pdf-notes/chebychev-polynomials" />

**Systems Programming:** In 2024, I started using Rust for hobby projects.

* TODO

**Teaching**:  These words [from an interview](https://youtu.be/F572OcpTcKY?t=582) with Brennan Lee Mulligan capture my feelings well:

> When I am with someone who is looking for something that I have, and I can
> give it to them -- the look on someone's face when they *get* it, and it
> becomes *theirs* as well...  
>
> The lighting of a second candle does not diminish the first.  Watching someone
> learn is one of life's greatest joys.  When you're a teacher you have a front
> row seat to learning, which is just -- the most beautiful thing to watch.

* At EmbodyMe, I led a biweekly deep learning & computer graphics reading group.
* At the University of Michigan, I co-founded [MSAIL](https://msail.github.io/), a student organization aimed at getting undergraduates involved with machine learning research. */}
