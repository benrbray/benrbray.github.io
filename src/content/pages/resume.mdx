## Skills

**Functional Programming:**  I currently use Haskell in my work as a research
engineer at Hasuo Lab @ NII.  I enjoy the expressiveness and safety that
comes with pure, statically-typed functional programming.  Learning Haskell has had a big positive impact on how I solve problems
in other languages, as well.

* I used Haskell professionally for 2 years in my role as a research engineer for Hasuo Lab at NII.
* At Smartpay, I worked as a backend engineer writing functional Scala using the [typelevel/cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/) ecosystem.
* Here are a few projects I've written in Haskell:
  * [yagi-lang]() is a toy language for understanding dependent type theory
  * [borscht-hs]() is a command-line tool for managing my personal music library
  * datalog tagging system
  * coalgebraic product construction

**Compilers & Programming Languages Theory:** I enjoy reading papers about programming language theory, type systems, formal verification, and category theory in my free time.

* I have basic familiarity with the **Coq Proof Assistant**, after working through all the exercises in the Logical
Foundations (Pierce et al.) book, as well as portions of Certified Programming
with Dependent Types (Chlipala).
{/* * I’ve also read through the first 5 chapters of the Homotopy Type Theory:  Univalent Foundations of Mathematics book, to better understand the formal systems that powers proof assistants like Coq. */}
* TODO

**Graphics & Numerical Simulation:**

* I wrote a C++/CUDA simulation of 2D incompressible fluid flow, based on the “Stable Fluids” paper by Jos Stam.  I compared a few different numerical methods, including parallel Jacobi on the GPU and preconditioned conjugate gradient on the CPU.
* I completed graduate courses on computer architecture, compilers, and parallel computing.  My course projects were all written in C++.  Projects for the compilers course involved writing LLVM analysis / transformation passes on LLVM IR.

**Frontend Development:** I have 6 years of experience writing TypeScript.

* I created [Noteworthy](https://github.com/benrbray/noteworthy), a desktop Markdown editor with bidirectional links and interactive math editing.
* I maintain the following `npm` packages, written in **TypeScript**:
  * @benrbray/prosemirror-math is a plugin to the ProseMirror editor that adds support for interactive LaTeX equation editing.
  * @benrbray/remark-cite adds support for Pandoc-style citation syntax to the Remark markdown parser.

**Backend Engineering:**

* TODO


**Technical Writing:** Here are a few samples of my writing:

* TODO

**Systems Programming:** In 2024, I started using Rust for hobby projects.

* TODO

**Teaching**:  The following words [from an interview](https://youtu.be/F572OcpTcKY?t=582) with Brennan Lee Mulligan really resonate with me:

> The truth is this:  When I am with someone who is looking for something that I have,
> and I can give it to them -- the look on someone's face when they get it, and it becomes
> *theirs* as well...  
>
> The lighting of a second candle does not diminish the first.  Watching someone
> learn is one of life's greatest joys.  When you're a teacher you have a front
> row seat to learning, which is just -- the most beautiful thing to watch.

I had the pleasure of serving as a teaching assistant for the following courses. 

* (Teaching Assistant) ISYE 6740, Computational Data Analysis, (Spring 2020, Georgia Tech)
* (Lecturer/TA) CS 4540, [Advanced Algorithms for Machine Learning](https://cs4540-f19.github.io/) (Fall 2019, Georgia Tech)
* (Lecturer/TA) CS 4540, [Advanced Algorithms for Machine Learning](https://cs4540-f18.github.io/) (Fall 2018, Georgia Tech)
* (Instructional Aide) EECS 445, Machine Learning, (Winter 2017, University of Michigan)
* (Instructional Aide) EECS 445, [Machine Learning](https://eecs445-f16.github.io/) (Fall 2016, University of Michigan)
* (Instructional Aide) EECS 545, [Graduate Machine Learning](https://github.com/thejakeyboy/umich-eecs545-lectures) (Winter 2016, University of Michigan)
* (Math Lab Tutor) MATH 425, Introduction to Probability, (Fall 2015 - Winter 2016, University of Michigan)

I also have a habit of starting reading groups wherever I work!

* At NII, I formed a weekly category theory reading group with each batch of summer interns.
* At EmbodyMe, I led a biweekly deep learning & computer graphics reading group.
* At the University of Michigan, I co-founded [MSAIL](https://msail.github.io/), a student organization aimed at getting undergraduates involved with machine learning research.

**Machine Learning / Optimization**:  Much of my coursework focused on machine learning and numerical methods.  Topics included probabilistic graphical models, Bayesian inference, numerical linear algebra, convex optimization, deep learning, and scientific computing.

> **TODO:** combine with the "numerical methods" above, and frame the ML experience as "optimization+numerical methods" experience

* In my role as a Machine Learning & Graphics Engineer at EmbodyMe, 
  - I maintained our Python/PyTorch codebase (which includes training and visualization code for face-reenactment and inpainting models).
  - I led a biweekly deep learning & graphics reading group to follow recent developments (GANs / attention / transformers / distillation / NeRF) and distribute knowledge among the team.
* As an undergraduate student, I spent three years as a research assistant using natural language processing to analyze a large corpus of 19th-century German periodicals.
  -  I implemented algorithms for topic modeling (LDA/HDP) from scratch in Python.
  - I designed a custom OCR error correction scheme for German blackletter fonts.
  - I trained a logistic regression classifier for place-name detection.
  - I built a web-app allowing humanities researchers to browse our dataset and visualize the results of our topic modeling analysis.
