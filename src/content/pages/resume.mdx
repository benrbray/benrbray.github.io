{/* <PostPreview postSlug="frontend/solidjs-vs-react" /> */}

### Backend Engineering

* I collaborated with our frontend team to design a **GraphQL** API to power our mobile app.
* <u>Technologies:</u> Scala (with [cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/)), Docker, Google Cloud Platform, Postgres, Terraform Cloud

I also have experience with the following backend tech:

* Building backend services with [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en), Scala's [`http4s`](https://http4s.org/), and Haskell's [`servant`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant).
* Containerizing networked applications with **Docker**.
* Writing GitHub Actions for **continuous integration** and other automations.

### Functional Programming, Compilers, and Formal Methods

<TodoBlock>
I work as a **research software engineer** for [Hasuo Lab](https://group-mmm.org/~ichiro/) at the <a href="https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/">National Institute of Informatics</a> in Tokyo, where I build software aimed at making formal methods more accessible to engineers working in industry.
</TodoBlock>

{/* I value the expressiveness and safety that comes with pure, statically-typed functional programming.
Functional programming is a valuable tool (but not the only one!) in my problem-solving toolkit.  
I've been writing Haskell professionally for 2 years.

I value the expressiveness and safety that comes with pure, statically-typed functional programming.  I'm especially interested in working on type systems and language servers.  */}

As a research engineer for Hasuo Lab at NII, I used **Haskell** to develop domain-specific programming languages for formal verification of cyberphysical systems, in collaboration with researchers from Japanese car manufacturers.
  * I worked on a **language server** for `tempo-lang`, a specification language which compiles to [**signal temporal logic**](https://finkbeiner.groups.cispa.de/publications/FFKK22.pdf) expressions.  I also extended the parser and typechecker to support record types, enums, and user-defined functions.
  * I also worked on an **exemplifier** which generates examples of signals which either satisfy or violate the temporal property described by a `tempo-lang` specification.  We achieved this by converting `tempo-lang` expressions into [satisfiability problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories), and reconstructing a signal from satisfying assignments found by the [`z3` SMT solver](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/z3-3/).
  * You can learn more about our work by reading [this paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2403.18764) or [these slides](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Aj26oQ_Up7Sxg_lcdJOjgBjSL1EzDA?e=bfbg17).

As a backend engineer at Smartpay, I wrote purely-functional **Scala** in tagless-final style using the [`cats-effect`](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/) ecosystem.  Scala's 

* A [functional core, imperative shell](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell/) architecture enabled us to work quickly, with confidence.

Here are a few related personal projects:

* In my free time, I enjoy working with **dependently-typed** languages like Coq, Idris and Lean.  I created the toy language [`yagi-lang`](https://github.com/benrbray/yagi-lang) to learn more about dependent type theory.
  <PostPreview postSlug="projects/yagi-lang" />

<TodoBlock> 
* Hindley Milner Implementation
* Borscht Music Database
* **TODO:** datalog tagging system
* **TODO:** coalgebraic product construction
* **TODO:** type safari
</TodoBlock>

{/* * I have basic familiarity with the **`coq` proof assistant**, having worked through all the exercises in Volumes 1-3 of the [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/) book, as well as portions of [CPDT](http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/). */}
{/* * I’ve also read through the first 5 chapters of the Homotopy Type Theory:  Univalent Foundations of Mathematics book, to better understand the formal systems that powers proof assistants like Coq. */}
{/* I enjoy reading papers about programming language theory, type systems, formal verification, and category theory in my free time. */}


### Graphics & Numerical Simulation

I worked for 2 years as a **Machine Learning & Graphics Engineer** at [EmbodyMe](https://embodyme.com/).

* I wrote a C++/CUDA simulation of 2D incompressible fluid flow, based on the “Stable Fluids” paper by Jos Stam.  I compared a few different numerical methods, including parallel Jacobi on the GPU and preconditioned conjugate gradient on the CPU.
* I completed graduate courses on computer architecture, compilers, and parallel computing.  My course projects were all written in C++.  Projects for the compilers course involved writing LLVM analysis / transformation passes on LLVM IR.
* In my role as a **computer vision engineer** at EmbodyMe, I trained deep learning models to transfer facial expressions from one video to another.  I also contributed to graphics the post-processing pipeline; for example, by applying spherical harmonics lighting to the meshes output by our model.
  - I maintained our Python/PyTorch codebase (which includes training and visualization code for face-reenactment and inpainting models).
  - I led a biweekly deep learning & graphics reading group to follow recent developments (GANs / attention / transformers / distillation / NeRF) and distribute knowledge among the team.
* As an undergraduate student, I spent three years as a research assistant using natural language processing to analyze a large corpus of 19th-century German periodicals.
  -  I implemented algorithms for topic modeling (LDA/HDP) from scratch in Python.
  - I designed a custom OCR error correction scheme for German blackletter fonts.
  - I trained a logistic regression classifier for place-name detection.
  - I built a web-app allowing humanities researchers to browse our dataset and visualize the results of our topic modeling analysis.

Early in my career, I also worked as a freelance **game developer**.  Read more by following the link:

{/* These words [from an interview](https://youtu.be/F572OcpTcKY?t=582) with Brennan Lee Mulligan capture my feelings well:

> When I am with someone who is looking for something that I have, and I can
> give it to them -- the look on someone's face when they *get* it, and it
> becomes *theirs* as well...  
>
> The lighting of a second candle does not diminish the first.  Watching someone

> row seat to learning, which is just -- the most beautiful thing to watch.
