## Product Development

As a **Research & Development Engineer** for [Hasuo Lab](https://group-mmm.org/~ichiro/) at the National Institute of Informatics,

* I worked closely with researchers to help translate their academic work into proof-of-concept software tools aimed at improving **formal verification** workflows in the automotive industry.
* When planning each project, I considered carefully  how best to leverage my teamâ€™s core competencies to solve problems brought to us by collaborators from Japanese automotive companies.
* I contributed to the successful delivery of four prototypes:
  * A **model checker** for a simple imperative probabilistic programming language.
  * A domain-specific language called `tempo-lang` which compiles to **signal temporal logic** expressions, along with a **language server** and web app for creating, documenting, and exemplifying specifications. (see [[Reimann 2024]](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2403.18764))
  * A web app for demonstrating the behavior of [RSS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03418) safety conditions (see [[Hasuo 2022]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02387))
  * A proof checker for Differential Floyd-Hoare Logic (see [[Hasuo 2022]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02387))
* I presented our work at the [IAA Mobility 2023](https://www.iaa-mobility.com/en/visitors/the-iaa-mobility-2023) trade show in Munich, Germany.
* You can learn more about our work by reading [paper1](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2403.18764), [paper2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02387), [these slides](https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21APC5eBa3EPJTN38&id=B1B4A7D40FA1BA3D%2165712&cid=B1B4A7D40FA1BA3D&parId=root&parQt=sharedby&o=OneUp), or this [brochure](/files/jst-news-2024-may-05.pdf).

Many of my [open-source](#open-source) projects are aimed at designing better software for students and researchers, whose needs are often underserved by commercial software:

* I created [Noteworthy](https://github.com/benrbray/noteworthy) to experiment with new ways to support WYSIWYG editing of documents making extensive use of math, diagrams, links, and academic citations.
* I created [`prosemirror-math`](https://github.com/benrbray/prosemirror-math) in order to encourage more widespread adoption of user-friendly LaTeX math input on the web.  With <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@benrbray/prosemirror-math"><img style="display:inline-block; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; margin-top: -0.15em" src="https://img.shields.io/npm/dw/%40benrbray%2Fprosemirror-math?label=prosemirror-math&labelColor=%23e3e3e3&color=%23b1da9c" alt="~1.8k" /></a> weekly downloads and [adoption](https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/99411/available-for-beta-testing-math-support-in-notes) by the [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) reference manager, I like to think that I've already had an impact!

I find it immensely satisfying to work on projects tailored to meet the needs of a niche audience who will benefit directly from my improvements.  A good user experience is at the forefront of all the work that I do.

 {/* and I've honed all the skills listed on this page in service of that goal. */}

## Frontend Engineering

I have 7 years of experience writing **TypeScript**, both at work and for open source projects.

* I'm proficient with both the **React** and **SolidJS** reactive UI frameworks.
* I have a deep working knowledge of the [**ProseMirror**](https://prosemirror.net/) and [**CodeMirror**](https://codemirror.net/) editor toolkits.
* I've worked briefly with **WebGL** and **Rust+WebAssembly**, and would enjoy diving deeper.

I enjoy designing **rich document editors** for note-taking, documentation, and academic writing.

* I created the [Noteworthy](https://github.com/benrbray/noteworthy) WYSIWYG desktop markdown editor, tailored for personal research notes making extensive use of math and citations.  Built with TypeScript and [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/).
* I maintain the [`prosemirror-math`](https://github.com/benrbray/prosemirror-math) and [`remark-cite`](https://github.com/benrbray/remark-cite) packages on NPM.

  { slug: "project/remark-cite", span: 1 },
]} />

## Backend Engineering

I worked for one year as a **backend engineer** at Smartpay KK, a Japanese fintech startup.

* I led the design, implementation, testing, and release of a programmatic disbursements backend service which integrates with bank APIs to automatically issue merchant payouts and consumer refunds on a fixed schedule.
* I participated in code review, API design, and sprint planning for a backend API powering the mobile & web apps for a pay-later service.
* I collaborated with our frontend team to design a **GraphQL** API to power our mobile app.
* <u>Tools:</u> Scala (with [`cats-effect`](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/)), Docker, GCP, PubSub, Postgres, Terraform Cloud

I also have experience with the following backend tech:

* Building backend services with [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en), Scala's [`http4s`](https://http4s.org/), and Haskell's [`servant`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant).
* Containerizing networked applications with **Docker**.
* Writing GitHub Actions for **continuous integration** and other automations.

## Functional Programming, Compilers, and Formal Methods

While working as a **Research Engineer** for Hasuo Lab at NII, **Haskell** was my daily driver for implementing parsers, interpreters, type inference algorithms, and a language server.

* I added support for user-defined functions, enum types, and record types to a domain-specific language called `tempo-lang`, which evaluates to **[signal temporal logic](https://finkbeiner.groups.cispa.de/publications/FFKK22.pdf)** expressions.
* We used [`sbv`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sbv) to support [`z3`](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) SAT/SMT formulas as a compile target for our `tempo-lang` DSL.
* <u>Tools:</u> `servant`, `aeson`, `mtl`, `transformers`, `megaparsec`, `quickcheck`, and a dash of `lens`.

As a **Backend Engineer** at Smartpay, I wrote purely-functional **Scala** in tagless-final style using the [`cats-effect`](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/) ecosystem.  Compared to Haskell, Scala takes a more pragmatic approach to functional programming, allowing for _gradual adoption_ of functional patterns where they pay off the most.

* A [functional core, imperative shell](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell/) architecture allowed my team to build new features quickly, with confidence that the underlying operations were sound.
* [`cats-effect`](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/) made it easy to mock side-effects in our [`hedgehog`](https://hedgehogqa.github.io/scala-hedgehog/) property-based tests.

In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with **dependently-typed** languages like Coq and Lean.  I'd love to work on tools which make dependently-typed programming more user-friendly.  I created the toy language [`yagi-lang`](https://github.com/benrbray/yagi-lang) to learn more about dependent type theory and language implementation:

<PostPreview postSlug="project/yagi-lang" />

## Computer Graphics & Numerical Methods

I'm comfortable with the foundations of computer graphics, including:

* linear algebra, matrix calculus, differential equations
* OpenGL, WebGL, rendering pipeline, shaders
* physically-based animation (collision detection, constraint resolution, fluid simulation)
* classic shading techniques as well as the basics of physically-based rendering
* the basics of [discrete differential geometry](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/DDG/) for mesh processing

As a **Computer Vision Engineer** at [EmbodyMe](https://embodyme.com/), I trained deep learning models for facial expression transfer, and contributed to our graphics pipeline, which applied spherical harmonics lighting and other post-processing effects to enhance the realism of meshes output by the deep learning model.

Stemming from my interest in physical simulation for games, I elected to take several project-based courses (in `C++`, `CUDA` and `python`) on numerical analysis during my undergrad and masters.  Topics included:

* matrix norms, conditioning, stability, error analysis
* fixed point methods, gradient descent, Newton's method
* convex optimization, linear programming, linear complementarity problems, Frank-Wolfe
* stationary iterative methods; conjugate gradient and Krylov subspaces; Chebychev polynomials
* nonuniform FFT and butterfly algorithms; Ewald summation; multigrid; fast multipole methods
* Finite element analysis; molecular simulation with hydrodynamic interactions

Here are a few notable projects I've worked on, either through coursework or out of personal interest:

* (*ongoing*) A **Rust** implementation of the *sequential impulse* algorithm for <u>2D rigid body physics</u>, based on Erin Catto's description of the classic Box2D solver.
* A **C++/CUDA** simulation of 2D <u>incompressible fluid flow</u>, based on the "Stable Fluids" paper by Jos Stam, using a parallel Jacobi method on the GPU.
* A **TypeScript** implementation of 2d collision detection using tests based on both the <u>Separating Axis Theorem</u> the <u>Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi</u> distance algorithm

As a teenager I worked as an independent **game developer**, publishing Flash games to the Newgrounds game portal under the username [archawn](https://archawn.newgrounds.com/games).  My games earned a modest amount of money from ad revenue and sponsorships through the [Flash Games License](https://web.archive.org/web/20130216211457/https://www.fgl.com/) marketplace.  You can play a collection of my early games at the link below.

## Machine Learning

In my role as a **Computer Vision Engineer** at [EmbodyMe](https://embodyme.com/),

* I used **PyTorch** for training deep learning models to transfer facial expressions from an input video onto a target image in *real time*.  At a high level, our model operated on face blendshapes produced by [MediaPipe](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/mediapipe), and we applied various graphics post-processing techniques to achieve a realistic result.  We used a separate model for mouth inpainting.
* I led a biweekly deep learning & graphics reading group to follow recent developments (GANs, attention, transformers, distillation, NeRF) and distribute knowledge among the team.
* <u>Tools:</u> Python, PyTorch, ONNX, MediaPipe, PyOpenGL

I spent 3 years as an **Undergraduate Research Assistant** using **statistical topic models** to analyze a large corpus of 19th-century German periodicals.  During the course of the project:
  -  I implemented algorithms for topic modeling (LDA/HDP) from scratch in Python, designed a custom OCR error correction scheme for German blackletter fonts, and trained a logistic regression classifier for place-name detection.
  - I built a web-app allowing humanities researchers to browse our dataset and visualize the results of our topic modeling analysis.


<PostSummaryFromSlug postSlug="project/dhgp/dhgp" show={{ summary: false }} />

I have also served as a **lecturer** and **teaching assistant** for a several courses in Machine Learning at the undergraduate & graduate levels.  See the [teaching](#teaching) section below for more details.
